For instance, Sellers have purchased items from the official website of eDropShip and started selling. Then it means that these items are not their personal items. However, they have sourced or purchased these items for selling or regulating their business activities. In such case, Sellers will be required for the registration of their account with appropriate, proper and applicable Sales Channel. It generally mean:
                                                    <ul>
